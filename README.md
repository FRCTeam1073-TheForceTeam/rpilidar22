# rpilidar22
RPLidar A2M6 processing for WPILib.py on Raspberry PI
## Project Status
**In Pre-Season Development**
## Project Description
Pre-season programming, testing, and documentation for FRC Team 1073's LiDAR unit. Using serial ports to test the unit outside of the robot's environment, this project has the final goal of creating a part of an advanced sensor system that can eventually be integrated into the team's '22-'23 robot for the autonomous period and extended Network Tables feedback. 
## T.O.C.
*will update this section later*
## Installation
Needed:
- [puTTY] (https://www.putty.org/), ssh & telenet product that aids in a serial port connection outside of the roborio.  
- [Repository for LiDAR-based SLAM in Python] (https://github.com/122004/BreezySLAM). The RP Lidar libraries are in C++, so this is needed as our robot uses primarily Java for our subsystems and Python for our sensors. **Special thanks to [Atsushi Sakai] (https://github.com/AtsushiSakai)**
- *If this sensor is a priority for your team, please consider coding the whole system in C++ to integrate it into your robot code as a whole. That being said, this repository is primarily for those looking to work in Java/Python*
## Usage
Use [WPILib.py](http://wpilibpi.local/) to connect with the Raspberry PI.
